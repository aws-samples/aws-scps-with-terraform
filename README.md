## AWS SCPs with Terraform

An efficient way to deploy [Service Control Policies (SCPs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html) with Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## Limitations

- [SCP Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html) 

## Deployment
This pattern defaults to SCPs for Root, Sandbox, and Workload OUs. If the pattern is not edited, it will deploy example SCPs to these OUs. This is obviously *not* recommended. 

### Customize to your OU structure
Using the default code and policies as a guide rail: 
1. Add or edit the variables in `config.auto.tfvars` and `variables.tf`.
2. Add or edit the module blocks in `main.tf`.
3. Add or edit the directories in the `policies` directory to align with your OUs.

### Deploy SCPs
1. Drag + drop your SCP `json` templates in the correct directory in `policies`. 
2. Initialize the directory and apply. 

... thats it. The module does the undifferentiated heavy lifting and applies it to the specified OUs. 

## Example SCPs

There are a series of example SCPs available in the `policies` directory. Before you edit and deploy them, ensure that you carefully consider the requirements of your organization and the impact that these controls may have.
